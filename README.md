## Build Instructions
You will need to have installed sac2c and have a copy of the Stdlib installed as well. It is also assumed that the submodules are initialized and updated correctly either via cloning with `--recurse-submodules` or as follows:
```bash
git submodules init
git submodules update
```

When submodules are in order follow the following build instructions to build the library:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
```

### Troubleshooting
#### macOS 11 (Big Sur)
Whenever the error:
`ld: library not found for -lcjson`
is encountered it can be remedied by running the following export.
`export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:{/absolute/path/to/cjson/lib/}`
